# tsf-task02-opticalcharacterrecognition

This was my second task as a Computer Vision & IoT intern at The Sparks Foundation, in this task, I was told to implement an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using any approach, mine was using PyTesseract and Tesseract-OCR, a C++ written program used for OCR along with OpenCV in Python.

First of all you need to download the Tesseract-OCR setup from the below link and install it in "C:\Program Files":
github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

Code files can also be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r06fO_SR_SwBDpfHbf41zhGjn4g9dHnI?usp=sharing
 
A video demonstration of the code can be seen at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe_nvyJ4q_k

Feel free to leave any suggestions, opinions or even criticism
